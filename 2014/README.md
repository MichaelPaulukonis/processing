Various processing sketches that I feel are workable enough to go online.

Some of these have "graduated" to "WebSketches" - their further web development lies in that repository.

pixl8tr cannot be run from file since it uses AJAX to load the .pde, so must be run on a web-server (I use XAMPP for development).
