# PIXL8TR

Animated gifs of image undergoing successive pixellation

## Originall in Processing, then Processing.js

I do not know if this works standalone (ie, as a Processing sketch on desktop) anymore. Doubtful.

## Roadmap

- break apart `upload.js` which contains both notes and gui and other code
- convert to p5js and other GUIS, maybe?
- Add a slider to allow to skip to different frames
- Allow to download each frame individually (or as a set of frames)
- select different focus location for the pixellation
- posterize colors?
- no partial squares - divide by width
